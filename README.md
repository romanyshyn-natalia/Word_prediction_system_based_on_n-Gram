# Project name: Words prediction system based on N-gram Language Model

#### Semester project of Architecture of Computer System course

## Project Aim 
Implement language model for parallel n-gram extraction from large text corpora (~40Gb) and create GUI application 
for its usage.

## Requirements
Based on implemented algorithms develop an application that will work in two modes: training and testing.

User sets text corpus for learning and select additional settings for training: number of grams, data filtration, 
  settings of parallelization, etc.). The program should generate statistics on analysis and performance in the results 
  window.
